 Brief description of the game developed 1/2 sentences:
 ======================================================
 This is an awsome shooter of a single space cowboy armed with a single blaster against hordes of never ending alien scum.
 
 Keystrokes only no mouse interaction:
 =====================================
 - (w or W) optiopnal up arrow key to move up
 - (s or S) optiopnal down arrow key to move down
 - (a or A) optiopnal left arrow key to move left
 - (d or D) optiopnal right arrow key to move right
 - (holding down 2 keys will allow verticle movement also for example UP & Left to move diagonally in that direction)
 - Space bar to fire (hold down for full auto)
 - Hold letter "b" down when moveing will give a speed booste
 - "y" and "n" to restart and end game in Highscore view
 
 Known bugs/problems:
 ====================
 I had to use nunber 9 to start the game as there was a chance when user used the JOptionPane they
 would hit Enter instead if clicking ok button as ENTER is used in the user text interface to start game
 so i changed the start game key to 9 instead to avoid possible conflict.
