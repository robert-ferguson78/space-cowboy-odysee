 Part A - Mark (11 /11)
 -----------------------------
 
 Includsion of completed:
 - Readme            (1)
 - Reflection        (4)
 - Video             (4)
 - Blog              (2)
 
 These are all created to spec, so I am awarding myself 11 marks.
 
 
 Part B - Mark (4 /4)
 -----------------------------
 
 - Comments,
 - Indentation,
 - Naming,
 - Structure of code.
 
 I am awarding myself 4 marks.
 
 
 Part C - Mark (X /5)
 -----------------------------
 Use of standard programming control constructs
 (if, loop, nesting):
 
 * if statements
 
 line 10 is an IF to validate ...
 line 20 is an IF to check ...
 line 24 is an IF with multiple branches for determing which key was pressed
 
 * Loops
 
 FOR loops used on:
 line 43 to draw aliens
 line 70 to draw bonus pickups
 
 DO While loops use on:
 line 90 to keep the program going (resetting)
 line 108 to draw the fleet
 
 FOR EACH loops used on:
 line 99 to draw fleet
 
 NESTED loops used on:
 line 183 is the outer loop to draw aliens
 line 185 to the inner nested loop draw fleet
 
 line 193 is the outer loop to draw baddies
 line 195 to the inner nested loop draw baddies
 
 I have multiple examples of nesting, if statements and loops so 5/5 ** update X above!
 
 Part D1 - Mark (x /10)
 -----------------------------
 
 My game demonstrates use collision detection, scoring, live and the game resets correctly to play a new game.
 Therefore I score 6/10
 
 
 Part D2 - Mark (10 /10)
 -----------------------------
 I have a key handler set up on line 99
 it handles:
 - left (a or A)
 - right(d or D)
 - up(w or W)
 - down(s or S)
 
 - It also handles the cursor keys to navigate (left arrow, up arrow, right arrow, down arrow)
 
 Additional keys include
 - [space] to fire bullet
 - b to Boost speed
 - y or Y to to restart game
 - n or N to exit game
 - 1 for easy mode (difficulty)
 - 2 for normal mode (difficulty)
 - 3 for hard mode (difficulty)
 - 9 to start game after entering name
 
 I have working key handler, cursor keys too, and an additional 4 key features so I am awarding 10/10.
 
 
 Part D3 - Mark (10 /10)
 -----------------------------
 Collision detection BESPOKE METHODS defined in main program file:
 
 Method0() on line x to detect collision between goodGuy and badguy. Called on line ...
 
 --
 
 Method1() on line x to detect edge conditions. Called on line ...
 
 ---
 
 Method2() on line y to detect collision between projectile and badguy. Called on line ...
 
 Method3() on line z to to detect collision between projectile and Orb. Called on line ...
 
 Method4() on line z to to detect collision between orb and goodGuy. Called on line ...
 
 Method5() on line z to to detect collision between moving orb and game edges. Called on line ...
 
 I have the basic collision detection between 2 objects
 I am also checking edge conditions, and I have 4 other collision detections therefor I am scoring myself 10/10
 UPDATE X ABOVE!
 
 
 -----------------------------
 Part E USER DEFINED CLASSES
 -----------------------------
 
 Part E1 - Mark (x /10)
 -----------------------------
 Excluding the player class and the main program, I have 3 other classes defined in their own files/tabs:
 
 1- Scoreboard
 2- Bomb
 3- Bullet
 
 Each of these user-defined classes has appropriate fields, constructors, getters, setters. These are highlighted as follows:
 
 1.Scoreboard CLASS
 Fields begin line: 8
 Constructors begin line: 13
 Getters begin line: 36
 Setters begin line: 65
 Bespoke methods begin line: 21
 
 2.Bomb CLASS
 Fields begin line: 8
 Constructors begin line: 15
 Getters begin line: 51
 Setters begin line: 77
 Bespoke methods begin line: 25
 
 3.Bullet CLASS
 Fields begin line: 8
 OVERLOADED Constructors: 16, 23, 31
 Getters begin line: 66
 Setters begin line: 91
 Bespoke methods begin line: 39
 
 ...
 
 I have documented 3 classes and they include overloaded constructors therefore I am scoring 7/10
 UPDATE X ABOVE!
 
 
 
 Part E2 - Mark (x /10)
 -----------------------------
 
 Class bespoke methods i.e. private helper methods:
 
 I have private helper methods in 3 classes
 
 1. Scoreboard Class
 
 line 5 takes in 2 parameters and returns a value
 line 20 takes in 3 parameters and returns a value
 line 55 takes in 0 parameters and returns NO value
 
 2. Bomb Class
 
 line 5 takes in 2 parameters and returns a value
 line 15 takes in 3 parameters and returns a value. OVERLOADING the first method
 
 3. Bullet Class
 
 line 5 takes in 2 parameters and returns a value
 line 15 takes in 3 parameters and returns a value. OVERLOADING the first method
 
 Private help methods for 3 classes are highlighted showing multiple examples of Methods with no return values, return values, parameters, and overloading. I am awarding myself 10/10
 UPDATE X ABOVE!
 
 
 Part E3 - Mark (x /10)
 -----------------------------
 
 - The user-defined class(es) are USED in an appropriate manner
 
 multiple declarations of user defined classes are USED:
 [TABName]line x, to declare ...
 [TABName]line y, to declare ...
 
 [TABName]line x, to initialise ...
 [TABName]line y, to initialise ...
 
 getters/setters are USED on...
 [TABName]line y,
 ...
 
 default constructors USED on lines...
 [TABName]line y,
 
 overloaded constructors USED on lines...
 [TABName]line y,
 
 
 <<Summarise, and mark according to marking scheme>>
 
 ------------------------
 PART F - DATA STRUCTURES
 ------------------------
 
 Part F1 - Mark (x /10)
 -----------------------------
 - Use of a data structure to store information i.e. array
 
 <<use [TABName]line y to be specific>>
 
 declared on line...to ...
 initialized on line...
 used on line...
 ...
 
 Part F2 - Mark (10 /10)
 -----------------------------
 - Calculations performed on the information stored
 
 <<use [TABName]line y to be specific>>
 
 line X
 
 I am scoring 10/10
 ...
 
 
 TOTAL MARK = REPLACE THIS TEXT WITH YOUR TOTAL
 
 
 FINAL CHECK:
 I have checked the constraints and I am not breaking any constraints.
